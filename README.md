# CA472 template repo

A brief description of our project idea:

Our project idea is about introducing a website/application where users can create an account or login and given there current location or any location,
the user can select a certain time & date and see the available gym/fitness class etc. slots available. 
The user can benefit from not having to pay expensive gym membership fees and just a once off fee for that slot they have selected,
or for example if their own gym is fully booked up. 
Alternatively they will pay a membership fee to the app which we allow them to go to any of the signed up gyms without having to the one time payment,
but some gyms/fitness classes may have varied charges.
