A brief description of our project idea "GymNow":

“GymNow” is primarily an online gym comparison and online booking service. Furthermore, we facilitate a platform where the customer can communicate easily with gyms, personal trainers and fitness instructors. “GymNow” is a multi-sided platform that addresses some of the most significant issues in the industry today, such as the ever-increasing inflation on gym membership prices and the small to medium-sized gyms attempting to stay competitive with the bigger franchise gyms especially in cities. These are just some of the key issues we believe GymNow’s service addresses, by providing a service where gyms can display their facility on our platform free of charge, likewise gym customers have the opportunity to compare and contrast facilities and classes on our website and are no longer restricted to one-gym one-membership service. Small to medium-sized businesses who choose to utilize our booking service in conjunction with their business will benefit from greater control over their operations and improved management of their limited resources, which can be essential to their business being successful. Our goal with GymNow is to provide a new model for gym memberships and increase gym customers' options when exercising. We also want to support local small gyms and provide a platform for them to recover and thrive. We feel there is a major gap in the fitness market for our application and there are major values GymNow can provide for both gym customers and owners
